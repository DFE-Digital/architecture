# DfE Architecture
This site documents the architecture principles, standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when designing services.

It complements the [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[technology section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology),
which covers service design more broadly.

It should be used in conjunction with the
[DfE Digital Technical Guidance](https://dfe-digital.github.io/technical-guidance),
when building digital services.
