# Architecture Capability Framework

> This page is being drafted, but we wanted to share the information we'd gathered as soon as it was available. If you have any comments, please contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk))

## Purpose
This framework provides an outline of the roles, skills and experience that architects working within DfE have or would like to build.

We have published the our [DfE architecture capability framework](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/architecture/WorkplaceDocuments/Profession/Capability%20Framework/DfE%20Architecture%20Capability%20Framework%20v1.5.docx?d=wb8d7319a79104592ba8b4d0c9c5724d3&csf=1&web=1&e=KVquE7), focused initially on our enterprise, solution, technical and security architect roles. This will be expanded to include other architecture roles soon.

On these guidance pages, we summarise information in the framework, and describe some of the pathways into architecture and how to develop an architecture career.

The framework should help also people working and interacting with architects understand what we do and how we do it.

It builds on the [GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), extending the various skills, levels and mastery for the context of DfE.
