# Business Architecture

In DfE, business architects work in a variety of different contexts, performing various tasks. This guidance highlights Business Architecture best practice, in an effort to bring consistency to the practice as it matures in DfE.

Best practice helps business architects when creating artefacts - it can ‘jump start’ tasks which might otherwise need scoping, and support combining, comparing or contrasting artefacts.

Whilst several business architecture practices are suggested, they are not mandated in DfE. However, they are considered sensible in the context of DfE.

Business architects should refer to the [common definitions](../standards/common-definitions).


## Mapping

Maps are high-level visual representations of the 'things' being mapped.

Mapping should focus on two things as a minimum - visualisation of things mapped, and the relationships and flows between them.

The purpose of mapping is to aid the understanding of and communicate, regarding the things being mapped.

The recommended basic mapping tool is Microsoft Visio. For more complex mapping exercises, use ArchiMate compatible tools such as Archi.

A business architect might typically map value streams, business capabilities (and services that realise them), organisational structures and stakeholder relationships.


## Modelling

Models are detailed, structured representations of what is being modelled. 

Modelling in the context of business architecture should focus on describing and simulating business activities, or ‘what’ an organisation does.

The purpose of modelling is to aid analysis of business activities to drive improved decision making.

The recommended basic modelling tools are Microsoft Visio or Excel. For more complex modelling exercises, use ArchiMate compatible tools such as Archi.

What things might a business architect typically model? Business capabilities, processes, information/intelligence (data), operating models, services.
