# Architecture leads

Architecture leads work within a DfE portfolio or domain. They work closely with DDaT business partners and other DDaT specialists to support, steer and help join-up delivery.

They:

- assist, advise and guide programmes and projects, ensuring alignment with:
  - technical strategies
  - common patterns and components
  - architecture principles
  - architecture standards and assurance
- can help identify architects and other technical specialists needed to support delivery, specifically:
  - supporting recruitment of the right people to meet the needs of the portfolio / domain
  - working with delivery teams to align with architecture principles, standards and patterns
  - helping identify common goals / problems being solved across DfE and linking up
