# Common Components
Common components are software or technical systems that are created once and reused many times in different services or business contexts. They could be applications, data, integration, a network, security products, hosting. They are building blocks, typically mapped to a business or technical capability, which can be used to deliver modular services or systems of a higher order.

__Key characteristics__

Common components can be of any size but they all share the same characteristics:
1. They are designed according to common standards, principles and patterns, with independent quality assurance to ensure the principles and patterns have been applied.
2. They are designed and developed in a modular, scalable and resilient way to support ease of reuse and reliability.
3. They are mapped to a specific business or technical capability/service. This enables easy search and prevents duplication.
4. They are treated as an asset and therefore require asset lifecycle management – support wrap, continuous improvement, enhancement or replacement.
5. They are standalone but interoperable with other common components, such that change to one does not cause a ripple effect change to others.

## Why should we use common components? ##

The adoption of common components can bring significant benefits to DfE. Some of these benefits are:
- __Speed to market__ – reuse can save time to build, test and deliver services. We should not have to build services from scratch every time.
- __Reduced costs__ – the more we can reuse, the more we can save through reduced technical diversity or duplication, enabling us to focus our efforts on the differentiating or innovative aspects of the service.
- __Lower risk__ – building to common standards and through lifecycle management lowers the risk of failure.
