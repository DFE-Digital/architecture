# Governance and Design

## Design pack ##

![Design pack with example diagrams](../documents/design-pack)
![Design pack - just text](../documents/design-pack-just-text)

A design pack provides an overview of the scope, deliverables and complexities of implementing change in an IT system landscape. It should provide enough information for all interested or required parties to understand the changes needed and any new or improved functionality which the change will deliver. It should be useful in any delivery context, be that a digital, data or technology service.


Above all, a design pack should move the design process forward, enabling effective review and assurance of impending change. It should be a living, breathing artefact that is continually updated by the project or service team, in collaboration with an Architecture Partner.


It is important to remember that this document should be used as a template and adapted as necessary. Only certain views are necessary in order to ensure effective governance and assurance against IT strategy and technical standards.  

You must discuss the development of a design pack with your Architecture Partner and adapt appropriately.


## Our boards and forums ##

### Conceptual options and design peer review ###
All programmes / projects will complete the conceptual design pack, including options analysis and this will be peer reviewed by  at least two Enterprise architects and relevant stakeholders. Actions and decisions will be logged on the Architecture RAID log and added to the weekly governance communications.

### Logical design governance ###
Your architecture partner will work with you to confirm if the architecture change is significant and should be reviewed at ARB or if it will be peer reviewed.

#### Architecture Review Board (ARB) ####
The ARB is the central architecture governance board for significant architecture change DfE projects. Its scope includes DfE's Executive Agencies and, where appropriate, NDPBs.

To attend ARB you must submit a ARB passport, this helps lead the discussion at the board and a design pack with the conceptual/ logical design sections completed.

Purpose

The board is in place to:​

•Make enterprise-level decisions that are aligned with DfE and Data, Digital and Technology strategies and standards

•Inform and assure digital, data and technology choices

•Maintain oversight of design assurance through service delivery

•Break down siloed working to bring about consistency and clarity in design


#### Logical peer review ####
This is arrange by the architecture practice for projects where the architecture change is minimal.

A design pack with the conceptual/ logical design sections completed, is required.


### Physical design assurance ###
Design assurance ensures proportionate review of your technical designs takes place. Your Architecture Partner will work with you to agree the most appropriate route to endorse your work, which may involve one or more of the following activities.

#### Technical Design Authority (TDA) ####
TDA considers and approves physical designs. The membership includes architects and technical specialists from different domains, including representation from IT Systems Assurance, Cloud Operations and IT Service Management

To attend TDA you must submit the TDA security checklist and a design pack with the conceptual/ logical and physical design sections completed

#### Technical Show and Tells ####
It may be more appropriate for your project to bring architects and team members together for a technical show and tell. These are a great way to provide support, challenge and design assurance in a less formal setting

#### Physical design peer review ###
If there is a very minor change to a design or the solution is not complex, then a peer review with architects and technical specialists may be a more appropriate way of reviewing the change. Your Architecture partner will help ensure this takes place
