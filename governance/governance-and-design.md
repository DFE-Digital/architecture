# Governance and design

## Design pack

- [Design pack, with example diagrams](../documents/design-pack.docx)
- [Design pack, text only](../documents/design-pack-just-text.docx)

A design pack provides an overview of the scope, deliverables and complexities of implementing change in an IT system landscape. It should provide enough information for all interested or required parties to understand the changes needed and any new or improved functionality which the change will deliver. It should be useful in any delivery context, be that a digital, data or technology service.

Above all, a design pack should move the design process forward, enabling effective review and assurance of impending change. It should be a living, breathing artefact that is continually updated by the project or service team, in collaboration with an Architecture Partner.

It is important to remember that this document should be used as a template and adapted as necessary. Only certain views are necessary in order to ensure effective governance and assurance against IT strategy and technical standards.  

You must discuss the development of a design pack with your [Architecture Partner](../service-offer/our-service-offer) and adapt appropriately.

## Our boards and assurance forums

We provide governance and assurance of architecture and design at the conceptual, logical and physical stages.

### Conceptual options and design peer review
All programmes / projects should complete a conceptual design pack (including options analysis) which will be peer reviewed by at least two Enterprise Architects and relevant stakeholders. Any resulting decisions and actions will be logged on the Architecture RAID log and added to the weekly architecture communications.

### Logical design assurance
Your [Architecture Partner](../service-offer/our-service-offer) will work with you to confirm if any architecture change is significant (novel or contentious) and should therefore be reviewed at ARB, or if a peer review is sufficient.

#### Architecture Review Board (ARB)
The ARB is the central architecture governance board for significant architecture change. Its scope includes DfE's Executive Agencies and, where appropriate, Arms Length Bodies (ALBs).

To attend ARB you should complete and submit an ARB passport. This helps lead the discussion at the board and a design pack with the conceptual/ logical design sections completed.

- [Design pack, with example diagrams](../documents/design-pack.docx)

The board's purpose is to:â€‹

- Make enterprise-level decisions that are aligned with DfE and Data, Digital and Technology strategies and standards
- Inform and assure digital, data and technology choices
- Maintain oversight of design assurance through service delivery
- Break down siloed working to bring about consistency and clarity in design

#### Peer review (logical)
This is arranged by the architecture practice for projects where the architecture change is minimal.

A design pack with the conceptual / logical design sections completed is required.

### Physical design assurance
Physical design assurance ensures proportionate review of your technical designs takes place. Your [Architecture Partner](../service-offer/our-service-offer) will work with you to agree the most appropriate route to review and endorse your physical design, which may involve one or more of the following activities:

#### Technical Design Authority (TDA)
TDA considers and approves physical designs. The membership includes architects and technical specialists from different domains, including representation from IT Security Assurance, Cloud Operations and IT Service Management.

To attend TDA, you must submit a completed [TDA security checklist](../documents/tda-security-checklist.xlsx) and a [design pack](../documents/design-pack.docx) with the conceptual, logical and physical design sections completed.

#### Technical Show and Tells
It may be more appropriate for your project to bring architects and team members together for a technical Show and Tell. These are a great way to provide support, challenge and design assurance in a less formal setting. As with other assurance activities, any resulting decisions and actions will be logged on the Architecture RAID log and added to the weekly architecture communications.

#### Peer review (physical)
If there is a very minor change to a design or the solution is not complex, then a peer review with architects and technical specialists may be a more appropriate way of reviewing the change. Your [Architecture Partner](../service-offer/our-service-offer) will help ensure this takes place.
