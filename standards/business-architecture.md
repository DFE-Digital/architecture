# Business Architecture

## Best practice

In DfE, business architects may be employed in various ways, performing various tasks. Whilst there may be inconsistency in what a business architect is tasked to do, it can be useful for DfE to have accepted best practice, focused on how usual business architecture tasks might be performed.

Accepted best practice helps provide business architects with guidance when creating artefacts. It can ‘jump start’ tasks which would otherwise need scoping, and support the combination and comparison of artefacts, by providing consistency if such activities are desired.

Many business architecture practices might be suggested or used in DfE. Whilst the practices offered below are considered sensible for DfE, none are mandated.

Business architects should refer to the [DfE Subject Taxonomy](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvedfe00014) and [common definitions](common-definitions) for terms and definitions, for descriptions of some of the ‘things’.


## Maps and mapping

Maps are high-level visual representations of the things being mapped.

Mapping should focus on two things as a minimum. Visualisation of things mapped and the relationships and flows between them.

The purpose of mapping is to aid the understanding of, and communicate regarding, the things being mapped.

The recommended basic mapping tool is Microsoft Visio. For more complex mapping exercises, use ArchiMate compatible tools, such as [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

What things might a business architect typically map? Value streams, organisational structures, stakeholder relationships.


## Models and modelling

Models are detailed, structured representations of what is being modelled.

Modelling in the context of business architecture should focus on describing and simulating business activities, or ‘what’ an organisation does.

The purpose of modelling is to aid analysis of business activities to drive improved decision making.

The recommended basic modelling tools are Microsoft Visio or Excel. For more complex modelling exercises, use ArchiMate compatible tools such as [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

What things might a business architect typically model? Business capabilities, processes, information/intelligence (from data), operating models, services.
