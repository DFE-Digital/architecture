# Business Architecture

In DfE, business architects may be employed in various ways, performing various tasks. Whilst there may be no consistency in what a business architect is tasked to do it can be useful for DfE to have accepted practice focused on how usual business architecture tasks might be performed.

Accepted practice helps provide business architects with guidance when creating artifacts, can ‘jump start’ tasks which would otherwise need scoping and support combining, comparing or contrasting artifacts by providing consistency if such activities are desired.

Many business architecture practices might be suggested, none of which would be right or wrong. The practices offered are considered sensible for DfE, none are mandated.

Business architects should refer to DfE terms and definitions for descriptions of some of the ‘things’.


## Maps and Mapping

Maps are high-level visual representations of the things being mapped.

Mapping should focus on two things as a minimum. Visualisation of things mapped and the relationships and flows between them.

The purpose of mapping is to aid the understanding of and communicate regarding, the things being mapped.

Recommended basic mapping tool is Microsoft Visio. For more complex mapping exercises use ArchiMate compatible tools such as Archi.

What things might a business architect typically map? Value streams, organisational structures, stakeholder relationships.


## Models and Modelling

Models are detailed, structured representations of what is being modelled.

Modelling should focus on describing and simulating business activities, or ‘what’ a business does.

The purpose of modelling is to aid analysis of business activities to drive improved decision making.

Recommended basic modelling tool are Microsoft Visio or Excel. For more complex modelling exercises use ArchiMate compatible tools such as Archi.

What things might a business architect typically model? Business capabilities, processes, information/intelligence (data), operating models, services.
