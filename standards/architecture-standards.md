# Architecture standards

Like all UK Government departments, architects in DfE are guided by the [UK Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard),the [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) and [Government Functional Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards).

Architects in DfE should also be familiar with our [Enterprise Architecture principles](), [Technical Architecture principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/architecture/#technical-architecture-principles) and [Enterprise Data Architecture principles](). Architects involved in developing software should also be familiar with our [coding principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/coding-principles/) and [front-end development principles](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/principles/frontend-development-principles/). All these should be used to guide an architect's work.

Various technical standards exist (or are in development) and are relevant to architecture work in DfE. Dependent on their work, architects are trusted to apply the relevant standard(s):

- [API standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/guides/api-guidance/#dfe-api-standards)
- [Software development standards](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/), including things like [naming things](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/naming-things/), [storing source code](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/storing-source-code/) and [licensing software](https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/standards/licencing-software-or-code/)
- Data standards (tbc)
- Infrastructure and network standards (tbc)
- Security standards (in development)
- Guidance on [meeting accessibility standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps#meeting-accessibility-requirements) and the [technical standard for digital accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-website-and-mobile-application-accessibility-monitoring#technical-standard-for-digital-accessibility)

The application of standards is generally assured through co-design in teams, and peer review in architecture and technical communities. There are likely to be additional checks that standards have been met during service assessment. Occasionally, there may be spot checks to ensure consistent and appropriate application of standards.

Architects are responsible for architecture and design decisions in their respective portfolio, service or domain. They should be confident in representing these in their respective communities and any DfE governance or assurance forums. Typically, design decisions are recorded as [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../architecture-documentation/#architecture-decision-records) and stored alongside other design and technical documentation (ideally in Github).
