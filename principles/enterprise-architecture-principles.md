# Enterprise Architecture Principles

These principles are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate.
Architecture and design is a trade-off between competing pressures - these principles are
meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should
expect to be challenged if you go your own way. The principles are to guide future
and current architecture - use your judgement, but in general, follow the principle of
'reuse, before buy, before build'.

## Foundation Principles

### 1. User needs have primacy
