# Enterprise Architecture Principles

(Draft, structure only)

These principles are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate.
Architecture and design is a trade-off between competing pressures - these principles are
meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should
expect to be challenged if you go your own way. The principles are to guide future
and current architecture - use your judgement, but in general, follow the principle of
'reuse, before buy, before build'.

They seek to inform those seeking to invest in solutions for DfE of the architectural principles
that have been agreed, which will govern data, technology and applications investments.

The DfE Architecture Review Board will review and agree these principles on a 6 monthly basis.

## Foundation Principles
These are the foundation principles that guide the way in which DfE investments
in data, technology and applications will be undertaken.

### 1. User needs have primacy
_Statement_ - The direction set out by Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) directorates, and the path which it pursues, must always seek to solve business problems for DfE’s users – i.e. schools, teachers, providers, students, apprentices, industry, communities, partners and staff. The needs of these groups, and the DfE business areas that serve them, take primacy over other actors and constraints.

_Rationale_ - Identifying, defining and subsequently solving the right user problem is key. Using architecture techniques and tools, including frameworks and roadmaps, will demonstrate clear linkage to business priorities, drivers and associated problems. DDaT will deliver the outcomes that represent user needs as capabilities for DfE business areas.

_Implications_ - DDaT will pursue solutions in accordance with real user needs assuring that the path taken produces the right outcome. As a result of this principle:
*	DDaT must cultivate a deep understanding of business area strategy, direction, aspirations, challenges and needs using a portfolio, rather than a project, view.
*	DDaT must demonstrate understanding of user needs by using artefacts such as user stories and user journeys, to identify what is required of both DfE business and DDaT teams.
*	DDaT must ensure that all layers of data, application and technology services and solutions are focused on delivering user needs.
*	Solutions delivered by DDaT projects resulting in new or amended services will demonstrate user-centred outcomes.
