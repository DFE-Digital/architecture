# Business Architecture Principles

Business Architecture is a structured approach for aligning an organisation’s strategy with its operational delivery. For DfE it can provide insight into how DfE’s capabilities, its organisation and information can be best structured and utilised to bring value through the delivery of DfE’s public service mission and more broadly of transparency, accessibility, sustainability and the efficient use of resources.

Business Architecture principles serve as a set of rules and guidelines shaping business architecture activities and together with appropriate standards provide the consistency and required focus necessary to support high quality outcomes.

These principles should not be considered in isolation, rather they should build on Enterprise Architecture principles.

Like most principles they intend to be enduring and seldom amended.


## 1. Align with business strategy

Business architecture should always align with, and prioritise activities that support, DfE’s overall strategy and goals.

**Rationale**

*	Ensures that architectural recommendations and decisions regarding DfE’s capabilities, organisation and information directly support DfE’s strategy and goals.
*	Business architecture helps determine the structures that enable strategy to be executed effectively and efficiently.

**Implications**

*	All business architecture initiatives must demonstrate how they contribute to DfEs overall strategy and goals.
*	A solid understanding of DfE strategy and goals is a pre-requisite to embarking on business architecture.

## 2. The business drives the narrative

Business architecture activities are driven by the stakeholder voice. Business architects should be able to link work back to stakeholder requirements and present architecture options and alternatives based on requirements for stakeholders to review and approve.

**Rationale**

*	Satisfying stakeholder requirements provides an increased chance of delivering improvements through architecture lead business change.
*	By keeping a stakeholder-centric focus, the architect can design processes and solutions that enhance satisfaction and deliver value.

**Implications**

*	All business architecture initiatives must demonstrate how they contribute to business success.
*	Stakeholders play an important part in business architecture, their buy in and active engagement are essential to success.
*	Establish communication channels, involve stakeholders early in the design process, and maintain ongoing dialogue.

## 3. The greater the scope the greater the benefit

When mapping and analysing always aim to include as many of the core business architecture elements (capabilities, organisation, information and value streams) and as wide a view of the business as possible.

**Rationale**

*	Mapping in isolation will only provide a sliced view of an organisation, limiting analysis and limiting the ability to identify improvements.
*	Mapping all elements and relating elements to each other exponentially increases understanding of an organisation.
*	A holistic approach helps to avoid silos and ensures that changes in one area do not negatively impact others.

**Implications**

*	Time and effort required to map may be significant.
*	Time and effort required to maintain maps may be significant.

## 4. The aim of business architecture is to increase organisational value

Focus on identifying, creating, and optimising value. Prioritise activities that generate measurable outcomes or improvements for the DfE, rather than engaging in projects with unclear or marginal value.

**Rationale**

*	The DfE, as a public body must demonstrate value for money.
*	Public funds must be used efficiently to deliver maximum value.

**Implications**

*	Continuous review and optimisation of processes, leveraging technology for automation where appropriate, and minimising waste.
