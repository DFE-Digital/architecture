# Business Architecture Principles

Business Architecture is a structured approach for aligning an organisation’s strategy with its operational delivery. For DfE it can provide insight into how DfE’s capabilities, its organisation and information can be best structured and utilised to bring value through the delivery of DfE’s public service mission and more broadly of transparency, accessibility, sustainability and the efficient use of resources.Enterprise Architecture principles are general rules and guidelines that inform and support decisions in how DfE should deliver services, to align with its vision and objectives. 

Business Architecture principles serve as a set of rules and guidelines shaping business architecture activities and together with appropriate standards provide the consistency and required focus necessary to support high quality outcomes.

These principles should not be considered in isolation, rather they should build on Enterprise Architecture principles. Like most principles they intend to be enduring and seldom amended.


## 1. 1.	Align with business strategy

Business architecture should always align with, and prioritise activities that support, DfE’s overall strategy and goals.

**Rationale**

*	Ensures that architectural recommendations and decisions regarding DfE’s capabilities, organisation and information directly support DfE’s strategy and goals
*	Business architecture helps determine the structures that enable strategy to be executed effectively and efficiently.

**Implications**

*	All business architecture initiatives must demonstrate how they contribute to DfEs overall strategy and goals.
*	A solid understanding of DfE strategy and goals is a pre-requisite to embarking on business architecture.
