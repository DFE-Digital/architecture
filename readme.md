# DfE Architecture
This site documents the architecture principles, standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when designing services.

It complements the [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[technology section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology),
which covers service design more broadly.

It should be used in conjunction with the
[DfE Digital Technical Guidance](https://dfe-digital.github.io/technology-guidance),
when building digital services.

## Adding new guidance

Create a new Markdown (.md) file in the [DfE Architecture repo](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/enterprise-architecture) that follows this pattern, add a link to it
from this page, and make a pull request:

# What you're writing about

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why what you're
writing about is important. The [title should probably be a verb, not a
noun](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/22/good-services-are-verbs-2/) (e.g. "Storing source code", not "Code
repositories").

## User needs

Why do we do this? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this?

## Tools

What specific software (commercial or open source) do we use to help us do this?
```

The service manual has some useful information on
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).
