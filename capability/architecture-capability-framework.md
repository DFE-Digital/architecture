# Architecture Capability Framework

> This page is being drafted, but we wanted to share the information we'd gathered as soon as it was available. If you have any comments, please contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk))

## Purpose
This framework provides an outline of the roles, skills and experience that architects working within DfE have or would like to build.

We've published the first iteration of our [DfE architecture capability framework](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Businessoperationsplanningandperformance-CapabilityTeam/Shared%20Documents/Capability%20Team/Capability%20Frameworks,%20Assessment%20%26%20Career%20Pathways/Architecture/Architecture%20Capability%20Framework%20V1%20FINAL.docx?d=w070c3687bfd74cdb8e8269bd1962b681&csf=1&web=1&e=vckSwA), focused initially on our enterprise, solution and technical architect roles. This will be expanded to include other architecture roles soon.

On these guidance pages, we summarise information in the framework, and describe some of the pathways into architecture and how to develop an architecture career.

The framework should help also people working and interacting with architects understand what we do and how we do it.

It builds on the [GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), extending the various skills, levels and mastery for the context of DfE.

## The role of an architect through the delivery lifecycle
**Planning / inception / pre-discovery**
- Questions - What is the problem space? Is there a problem to solve?
- Focus - Problem framing, stakeholder mapping, input to business case

**Discovery**
- Questions - What is the problem? How big is it? Can we solve it?
- Focus - Problem statement, goals and drivers, conceptual views, business/technical capability mapping, early option thinking

**Alpha**
- Questions - What are our risky assumptions? How can we release value early?
- Focus - Solution prototyping, capability / service / application views, data architecture, design assumptions and constraints, options considered / tested

**Beta (private / public)**
- Questions - What should we build first and is it adding value?
- Focus - High > low level design (applications, data, integration, hosting, security), infrastructure / network topology, disaster recovery, logging, auditing, error handling, managing the service and support, architecture / design decisions

**Live**
- Questions - How can we continually add value to the service?
- Focus - Continual improvement, relationships with suppliers, learning/future recommendations

## The skills and experience you'll need
In DfE, we have a mix of enterprise, solution, technical and data architects. We also have tech leads and a Head of Profession - there are lots of different roles and teams that do architecture in one way or another, across a number of business areas.

Here are some of the more common roles:

### Enterprise Architects

Enterprise Architects generally work across the DfE at a strategic level, to translate business strategy into change and technical delivery.

Their responsibilities include:

- establishing broad architectural principles, policies and standards
- assuring technology decisions are aligned to architecture and technical strategies
- ownership of architecture strategy and roadmaps for the organisation, including ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ transitional states
- understanding DfE's ecosystem and its inter-dependencies

### Solution Architects

Solution Architects typically work within delivery teams to find the best use of data, applications and technology for the design and delivery of services and products. Whilst also helping to deliver business change and achieving organisational objectives.

Solution Architects own the overall technical vision for a solution or set of solutions, or within a particular domain. They work within service delivery teams to assure the implementation and delivery of those solutions.

### Technical Architects

Technical Architects are generally embedded within a multi-disciplinary team (or across multiple teams), working end-to-end to help to design and implement technical solutions. They are often specialists or technical subject matter experts in one or more disciplines (e.g. software development, data, security, DevOps). They tend to work in continuous delivery environments and are comfortable with turning business problems into technical design. They tend to be from a software development or engineering background and are comfortable using technical toolsets and / or code.

Technical Architects currently work in portfolios and service lines within DfE, such as those found in Teacher Services or Children and Families, for example. This role is aligned to the [Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/technical-architect) job family of the GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework.

*[Add read across with DDaT Tech Architect skill levels, standard job descriptions]*

### Specialist Architects

We also have [Data Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-architect-role-description/data-architect-role-description)
and other [Specialist Technical Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specialist-architect-role-description/technical-specialist-architect-role-description) (focused on things like security, infrastructure or networks, for example), who work closely with service delivery teams and the other parts of the department to help achieve our goals.

### Profession support

To keep everything running smoothly, we have a small profession team, comprising the Head of Profession (Luke Slowen), an architecture practice and community manager (Theresa Mercer) and some professional support (Indy Bains). Have a look at our [architecture profession page](../../profession/architecture-profession)

Architects (or those aspiring to be architects) should consider:

- Which level am I operating at?
- What else could / should I do?
- How can I create space to cover?
- What support do I need?

### Objectives
*[Add standard deliverables, expectaions at different levels, links to professional objective template]*

### Learning and development
Architects can find a multitude of self-serve learning and development resources on the [architecture toolkit](https://trello.com/b/2ahP5HcQ/architecture-toolkit). If you have any specific needs, or would like to set up some shadowing, coaching or mentoring, come and talk to the [profession team](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk).

### Community
The architecture community is there to support you in your developing your skills and experience. There are regular masterclasses and knowledge sharing sessions, as well as opportunities to hear from and engage with our suppliers. head over to the [architecture community page](../../profession/architecture-community) to read more.
