# Architecture Capability Framework

(Note - this page is being drafted, but we wanted to share the information we'd gathered as soon as it was available. If you have any comments, please contact the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk))

## Purpose
This framework provides an outline of the roles, skills and experience that architects working within DfE have or would like to build.

It describes the pathways into architecture and how to develop an architecture career. It should help also people interacting with architects understand what we do and how we do it.

It builds on the [GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), extending the various skills, levels and mastery for the context of DfE.

## The skills and experience you'll need
In DfE, we have a mix of enterprise, solution, technical and data architects. We also have tech leads and Heads of Profession - there are lots of different roles and teams that do architecture in one way or another, across a number of business areas. There is a central architecture team, as well as discreet architecture teams working across DfE.

Here are some of the more common roles:

### Enterprise Architects

Enterprise Architects work across the DfE at a strategic level to translate business strategy into change and technical delivery. EA's are part of the central architecture team.

Their responsibilities include:

- establishing the architectural principles, policies and standards
- assuring technology decisions are aligned to architecture and technical strategies
- ownership of architecture strategy and roadmaps, including ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ transitional states
- understanding DfE's ecosystem and its inter-dependencies

### Solution Architects

Solution Architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to find the best use of data, applications and technology to design and deliver services and products, whilst also delivering business change and achieving organisational objectives.

Solution Architects own the overall technical vision for a solution or set of solutions. They work with service delivery teams to assure the implementation and delivery of those solutions. There are SA's who work in service teams and / or directorates (e.g. ESFA) that tend to be long term assignments as well as SA roles in the central team that are deployed on shorter term ssignments.

### Technical Architects

Technical Architects tend to be embedded within a multi-disciplinary team, working end-to-end to help to design and implement technical solutions. They are often specialists or technical subject matter experts in one or more disciplines (e.g. software development, data, security, DevOps). They tend to work in continuous delivery environments and are comfortable with turning business problems into technical design. They tend to be from a software development or engineering background and are comfortable using technical toolsets and / or code. 

Technical Architects currently work in digital service lines within DfE, such as those found in Teacher Services, for example. This role is aligned to the [Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/technical-architect) job family of the GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework.

*[Add read across with DDaT Tech Arch skill levels, standard job descriptions]*

### Specialist Architects

We also have [Data Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-architect-role-description/data-architect-role-description)
and other [Specialist Technical Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specialist-architect-role-description/technical-specialist-architect-role-description) (focused on things like security or networks, for example), who work closely with service delivery teams and the other parts of the department to help achieve our goals.

And we have an architecture practice manager and some functional support, to keep everything running smoothly.

Architects (or those aspiring to be architects) should consider:

- Which level am I operating at?
- What else could / should I do?
- How can I create space to cover?
- What support do I need?

### Community

There is a thriving architecture community in DfE. We meet up monthly, to 'show and tell' good things that are happening in architecture and hear from wider Government, private sector, relevant suppliers and vendors on new, innovative solutions. And to just chat and share knowledge. You don't have to be an architect to join in - we often hear updates from business areas and those interested in what we're doing. If you want to get involved or have something to share, drop us a line in the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk).
