# Architecture Capability Framework

## Purpose
This framework is designed to help anybody interacting with the architecture team or wanting to get into architecture.
It outlines the roles, skills and experience that work within the department

## Pathways into architecture
*DDaT pathways + DfE - BA, Dev, DevOps*

## The skills and experience you'll need
This capability framework builds on the [GDS DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework).

*Skills & mastery (how DfE use and adapts), read across with DDaT Tech Arch skill levels*

In the DfE architecture team, we centre on Enterprise and Solution Architects.
We form part of a wider community of architects working across DfE, but have found
that these two roles tend to work best within the central team, working closely
with Technical Architects and those with other specialisms in project or service teams.

We broadly align our roles with the Technical Architect levels in the GDS DDaT Capability Framework:
  * Chief Architect = [Principle Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principal-technical-architect-skills-they-need/principal-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * G6 Enterprise Architect = [Lead Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lead-technical-architect-skills-they-need/lead-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * G7 Enterprise / Solution Architect = [Senior Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-technical-architect-skills-they-need/senior-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * SEO Solution Architect = [Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-architect-skills-they-need/technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * HEO Associate Architect = [Associate Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/associate-technical-architect-skills-they-need/associate-technical-architect-skills-they-need)

In the team, we also have [Data Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-architect-role-description/data-architect-role-description)
and [Specialist Technical Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specialist-architect-role-description/technical-specialist-architect-role-description),
who work closely with the Data Directorate and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) function.

We also have an architecture practice manager and some functional support, to keep everything running smoothly.
