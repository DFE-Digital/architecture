# Architecture Capability Framework

(Note - this page is being drafted, but we wanted to share the information we'd gathered as soon as it was available. If you have any comments, please contact the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk))

## Purpose
This framework provides an outline of the roles, skills and experience that architects working within DfE have or would like to build.

It describes the pathways into architecture and how to develop an architecture career. It should help also people interacting with architects understand what we do and how we do it.

It builds on the [GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), extending the various skills, levels and mastery for the context of DfE.

## The skills and experience you'll need
In the DfE architecture team, we have a mix of Enterprise, Solution and Technical Architects, plus some more specialist architects.
We form part of a wider community of architects and work closely with Technical Architects embedded in service delivery teams and other specialist architects working across the DfE.

We broadly align our roles with the Technical Architect levels in the GOV.UK DDaT Capability Framework:
  * Chief Architect = [Principle Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principal-technical-architect-skills-they-need/principal-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * G6 Enterprise Architect = [Lead Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lead-technical-architect-skills-they-need/lead-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * G7 Enterprise / Solution / Technical Architect = [Senior Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-technical-architect-skills-they-need/senior-technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * SEO Solution / Technical Architect = [Technical Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-architect-skills-they-need/technical-architect-skills-they-need)
  * HEO Associate Architect = [Associate Architect](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/associate-technical-architect-skills-they-need/associate-technical-architect-skills-they-need)

We use the skills, levels and mastery from these Technical Architect roles and adapt them for our roles in DfE.

### Enterprise Architects

Enterprise Architects work across the DfE at a strategic level to translate business strategy into change and technical delivery.

Their responsibilities include:

- establishing the architectural principles, policies and standards
- assuring technology decisions are aligned to architecture and technical strategies
- ownership of architecture strategy and roadmaps, including ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ transitional states
- understanding DfE's ecosystem and its inter-dependencies

### Solution Architects

Solution Architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to find the best use of data, applications and technology to design and deliver services and products, whilst also delivering business change and achieving organisational objectives.

Solution Architects own the overall technical vision for a solution or set of solutions. They work with service delivery teams to assure the implementation and delivery of those solutions.

### Technical Architects

Technical Architects tend to be embedded within a multi-disciplinary team, working end-to-end to help to design and implement technical solutions. They are often specialists or technical subject matter experts in one or more disciplines (e.g. software development, data, security, DevOps).

*[Add read across with DDaT Tech Arch skill levels, standard job descriptions]*

### Specialist Architects

In the team, we also have [Data Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-architect-role-description/data-architect-role-description)
and other [Specialist Technical Architects](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specialist-architect-role-description/technical-specialist-architect-role-description) (focused on things like security or networks, for example), who work closely with service delivery teams and the other parts of the department to help achieve our goals.

We also have an architecture practice manager and some functional support, to keep everything running smoothly.

- What else could / should I do?
- How can I create space to cover?
- What support do I need?

### Community

There is a thriving architecture community in DfE. We meet up monthly, to 'show and tell' good things that are happening in architecture and hear from wider Government, private sector, relevant suppliers and vendors on new, innovative solutions. And to just chat and share knowledge. You don't have to be an architect to join in - we often hear updates from business areas and those interested in what we're doing. If you want to get involved or have something to share, drop us a line in the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk).
