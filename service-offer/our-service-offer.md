# Our Service Offer

The architecture practice can help you find or access the right type of architecture support for your project.
We have access to a large community of permanent and contract architects across the Department and its Executive Agencies, plus commercial frameworks to help fulfill your needs.

In the first instance, you should discuss your needs with your Architecture Partner.

## Architecture Partners

Architecture Partners work across DDaT and are aligned to a DfE group or portfolio of work (e.g. ESFA, EYSG or SCMD). They work closely with DDaT business partners and Data and Digital leads to support, signpost and help join-up delivery.

They:

- assist, advise and guide programmes and projects, ensuring alignment with:
  - technical strategies, including reuse of common components, patterns and standards
  - architectural principles
  - architecture governance and design assurance
- should be engaged from idea conception and throughout delivery
- can help identify architects and resources needed to support delivery:
  - for new projects, they will guide the idea formation and assess the architectural services required to support the project (e.g. solution / technical architects), assisting in the project’s recruitment of those people / services  
  - for existing projects / services, they will work with the service delivery team to align with architectural principles and governance, assisting in identifying commonality across the enterprise and in finding the right solutions

To find out who your Architecture Partner is, contact the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.governance@education.gov.uk)

## Enterprise Architects

Our Enterprise Architects work across the DfE at a strategic level to translate the business strategy into business change and technical delivery.

Their responsibilities include:

- Establishing the architectural principles, policies and standards
- Assuring technology decisions are aligned to EA strategy
- Ownership of EA strategy and roadmaps from a business and technology perspective, including ‘as-is’, ‘to-be’ and transitional states
- Understanding the organisation's ecosystem and its inter-dependencies

## Solution Architects

Our Solution Architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to best use data, applications and technology to deliver business change and achieve organisational objectives, whilst supporting the design and development of services and products.

- They are in charge of the overall technical vision for the solution
- They assure the implementation and delivery of that solution

## Technical Architects

Like Solution Architects, Technical Architects tend to work within a multi-disciplinary team, helping to design and implement technical solutions.
They are generally specialists or technical subject matter experts in one or more disciplines (e.g. development, data, security, DevOps).

## Further guidance

More information on architecture roles and responsibilities is available on the [Architecture Capability Framework](../capability/architecture-capability-framework) guidance.
