# Our Service Offer

The architecture practice can help you find or access the right type of architecture support for your project.
We have access to a large community of permanent and contract architects across the Department, plus commercial frameworks to help fulfill your needs.

In the first instance, you should discuss your needs with your Architecture Partner.

## Architecture Partners

Architecture Partners work across DDaT and are aligned to a DfE group or portfolio of work (e.g. ESFA, EYSG or SCMD). They work closely with DDaT business partners and Data and Digital leads to support, signpost and help join-up delivery.

They:

- assist, advise and guide programmes and projects, ensuring alignment with:
  - technical strategies, including reuse of common components, patterns and standards
  - architectural principles
  - architecture governance and design assurance
- should be engaged from idea conception and throughout delivery
- can help identify architects and resources needed to support delivery:
  - guiding idea formation and supporting recruitment of the right architects to meet those needs Â 
  - working with a service delivery team to align with architecture principles and governance,
  - helping identify commonality across the enterprise and finding the right solutions

To find out who your Architecture Partner is, contact the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk)

## Help to find an architect

The architecture practice will work with you and your Architecture Partner to fulfill your needs. That could be assigning an architect from our team to your project or helping you bring in the right people or services, through one of our compliant commercial routes to market. This will enable you to:
- get the right architecture skills, at the right time, at the right price
- on-board architects into DfE properly, so they understand our ways of working and our governance framework
- provide oversight and assurance of their outputs and deliverables
- link them into the wider DfE architecture profession and community
- exit them professionally when their work is complete, with appropriate handover and knowledge transfer

If you'd like to know more, contact the [Architecture team](mailto:architecture.services@education.gov.uk).
