# Design assurance

> Architecture in DfE has moved to a more profession-led model. This content is under review. Contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) for more information.

## In-line assurance

We have different ways of delivering services in DfE. How we assure that technical design meets the necessary [standards](../standards/architecture-standards) needs to be flexible.
We need to ensure we're doing the right things (through governance) and doing things right (through assurance). And not slowing down delivery in the process.

The Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) or Service Owner (usually a Deputy Director) is accountable for all delivery within their service, programme or division. They rely on the advice of technical experts within their multi-disciplinary teams and portfolios when taking ownership of key technical decisions and risks for their domain. These responsibilities are at the heart of an 'in-line' assurance model.

Groups of people (such as the Digital and Technology Senior Leadership Team or Service Owner community) are collectively accountable for strategic technical decisions across the organisation, ensuring all cross-divisional or cross-functional impacts are considered. These groups are supported by technical specialists in professional communities.

We encourage an 'in-line' assurance model for architecture and technical design. You can read more about the evolving in-line assurance model and where this has been adopted or is being tested.

## Design assurance in delivery teams

We expect architectures will emerge and evolve over time, as services themselves change based on emerging user needs and other drivers, such as policy changes.

This requires ongoing and continuous review of architecture and technical design, to ensure services are being built sustainably and consistently, both across the service area and also the wider organisation.

Architects work closely with their delivery teams to facilitate this, alongside product managers, developers, service designers and many other people. They also work alongside their lead or principal architect, who will have a view across multiple services or domains, to ensure breadth and consistency in their designs.

Architects have access to a plethora of design skills and experience from across professional communities in DfE. They can use [architecture community meet-ups](../../capability/architecture-capability-framework/#community) to ask for help with design problems, or ask the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) to help facilitate a [peer review](#peer-review) of their design. Permanent (civil servant) architects have professional objectives that include supporting others in the community with peer review and preparation for service assessment.

## Things to help you

<a name="peer-review"></a>
### Peer review

The architecture profession can help you find the right people to review your design and provide helpful, constructive advice, whatever your stage of delivery. This could be early on when you're thinking about the problem space and options, or later on, when you have physical design.

Typically, you'd have a design and some narrative documented to share in advance of the session - this could be in a form of a passport, design pack or links to technical documentation on your repository/wiki. This gives reviewers the opportunity to understand the context and think of any burning questions about your design beforehand.

During the session, you'll walk through key points of your design, seek and discuss feedback. It should be an open, honest and constructive conversation, amongst trusted peers. You'll be expected to make notes yourself and summarise these (and any actions) back to the group. For particularly large or complex designs, the profession may be able to provide facilitation/secretariat support.

After the session, the profession will record any significant or cross-cutting architecture decisions and actions, and follow these up.

### Technical Show and Tells

It may be more appropriate for you to bring architects and team members together for a technical Show and Tell. These are a great way to provide support, challenge and design assurance in a less formal setting.

Contact the [architecture profession](mailto:architecture.profession@education.gov.uk) to get a slot at a community meet-up.

### Design pack

> These templates and examples require some re-work, to reflect our profession-led model for architecture, but they can still be used as a guide

- [Design pack, with example diagrams](../documents/design-pack.docx)
- [Design pack, text only](../documents/design-pack-just-text.docx)

These templates can be used as a guide when creating a design. Whether various elements are applicable will vary dependent on your particular circumstances, so treat these templates as a set of helpful things to consider as you draft your design. Of course, you're very welcome to use the document format as it stands, but many architects will want to replicate elements in their own service wikis and repositories.

Broadly, a design pack provides an overview of the scope, deliverables and complexities of implementing change in a service landscape. It should provide enough information for all interested or required parties to understand the architecture and design changes needed and any new or improved functionality that the change will deliver. It should be useful in any delivery context, be that a digital, data or technology service.

Above all, a design pack should move the design process forward, enabling effective review and assurance of impending change. It should be a living, breathing artefact that is continually updated by the project or service team, in collaboration with a lead architect.

It is important to remember that this document should be used as a guide and adapted as necessary.
